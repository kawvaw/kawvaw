- 👋 Hi, I’m @kawvaw (Jim!)
- 👀 I’m interested in a career in programming with JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, CSS, HTML...Using javascript.info, Traversy, Web Developer Bootcamp (my main learning tool).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who is learning JS, can help me, or I them with JS or advice on jobs, and anyone I can lift up and help along the way.
- 📫 I can be reached here (I guess? I am new), I am not sure posting my email is a very good idea...
- I am a Christ follower, I have studied Natural Theology (how far can we get without referring to a holy book?) If you are in need of guidance or comfort or help, just ask.
